# Welcome!

* Welcome to my personal Data Science portfolio!
* Here you're going to find **(1)** my latest **personal projects** and **(2)** recommended (free) materials for **learning and applying Data Science**.

## Professional Summary
* I have 9-year experience, combined, in Data Analytics, B2B Sales, and Software Development. Feel welcome to reach me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandodoreto/).
* Data Science for me is about **combining business awareness and technology**. 
* It doesn't matter if your technology is based on TensorFlow latest capabilities or on multiple Excel spreadsheets, if it's (1) integrated seamlessly with existing business processes and (2) reveals un-obvious/relevant insights, it worthed.

## Recommended (free) materials for Data Science
* [Google ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) - I found the courses very useful and easy to follow. I specially suggest Problem Framing course.
* [StatQuest YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw) - If you really want to understand (and apply) statistics and ML concepts, go there.
* [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/) - It shows not only technical aspects, but also project mgt, product design and business insights on how to succeed on AI systems. Guest lectures presentations showcase practical examples in real world.
* ALL Udemy courses from [Soledad G.](https://www.udemy.com/user/soledad-galli/) and [Christopher S.](https://www.udemy.com/user/christopher-samiullah/) - It's not free, but Udemy offers discounts very often. It gave me the practical foundation for ML systems. It worths to visit their [website](https://www.trainindata.com/) as well, great practical content. 
* [Machine Learning at Berkeley](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/tag/crash-course) - It offers a great technical foundation in ML.
