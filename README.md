# Welcome!

* Welcome to my personal Data Science portfolio! :rocket: :wave: 
* Here you're going to find **(1)** my latest personal projects and **(2)** recommended (free) materials for learning and applying Data Science.

## Professional Summary
* I have 9-year experience, combined, in Data Analytics, B2B Sales, and Software Development.
* Data Science for me is about **combining business awareness and technology**. It doesn't matter if your technology is based on TensorFlow latest capabilities or on multiple Excel spreadsheets, if it's (1) integrated seamlessly with existing business processes and (2) reveals un-obvious/relevant insights, it worthed.

## Recommend (free) materials for Data Science
* [Google ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) - I found the courses very useful and easy to follow. I specially suggest Problem Framing course.
* [StatQuest YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw) - I dont know why this channel is not used in all universities or at companies. If you really want to understand (and apply) statistics and ML concepts, go there.
* [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/) - "It helps you bridge the gap from training machine learning models to deploying AI systems in the real world". It shows not only technical aspects, but also project mgt, product design and business insights on how to succeed on AI systems. Guest lectures presentations showcase practical examples in real world.
* ALL Udemy courses from [Soledad G.](https://www.udemy.com/user/soledad-galli/) and [Christopher S.](https://www.udemy.com/user/christopher-samiullah/) - I know, it's not free. But at the same time, Udemy offers discounts every now and then. It gave me the practical foundation for ML systems. It worths to visit their [website](https://www.trainindata.com/) as well, great practical content. 
* [Machine Learning at Berkeley](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/tag/crash-course) - It offers a great technical foundation in ML.
