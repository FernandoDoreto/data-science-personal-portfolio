## Welcome!

* Welcome to my personal Data Science portfolio! Her you're going to find my latest personal projects and recommended (free) materials for learning and applying Data Science.

## Professional Summary
* I have 9-year experience, combined, in Data Analytics, B2B Sales, and Software Development.
* Data Science for me is about **combining business awareness and technology**. It doesn't matter if your technology is based on TensorFlow latest capabilities or on multiple Excel spreadsheets, if it's (1) integrated seamlessly with existing business processes and (2) reveals un-obvious/relevant insights, it worthed.
