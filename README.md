#  Welcome to Fernando Doreto's personal portfolio!

* Here you're going to find:
> * My latest **personal projects** and
> * Recommended (free) materials to **learn and apply Data Science**.

## Professional Summary
* I have 9-year experience, combined, in Data Analytics, B2B Sales, and Software Development. Feel welcome to reach me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandodoreto/).
* Data Science for me is about **combining business experience and technology**. 
  * It doesn't matter if your technology is based on TensorFlow latest capabilities or on multiple Excel spreadsheets, if it's (1) integrated seamlessly with existing business processes and (2) reveals un-obvious/relevant insights, it worthed. 

## Projects Portfolio
* **NOTES**: (1) when requested, both username and password are: **doreto**. (2) Apps are deployed in free Heroku tier, so **BOOT TIME** might take a few seconds.

> * **Regression**: Predictive ML model to inform rental bike levels based on weather and seasonal information. Learn how hour, working day, and temperature can affect rental. The actionable insights can help Operations and Marketing teams to drive better business decisions. [Click here](https://doreto-regression.herokuapp.com)
> * **Binary Classification**: Predictive ML model to classify a breast mass sample diagnosis as malignant or benign. Learn how the main features affect malignant/benign diagnostic; and check how the system is able to detect when input data is in a dubious range; helping the user to make more educated decision. [Click here](https://doreto-binary-clf.herokuapp.com/)
> * **Multiclass Classification**: Data driven decision for effective pricing strategy: how to determine the price range for a new mobile brand supplier? What are the main variables that affect price range and how do they interact? [Click here](https://doreto-multi-clf.herokuapp.com/)
> * **Clustering**: Prescriptive ML model to segment your customer base and identify which customers are more likely to churn. Check out each cluster profile; which variables are the most relevant and what makes a customer to churn . That can help Marketing and Sales teams to set more effective strategies to increase customer retention and satisfaction. [Click here](https://doreto-cluster.herokuapp.com/)
> * **Time Series**: Air pollution levels affect dramatically population health and may block or promote cities' development. This study considers air pollution records in Beijing, China from 2010 to 2015 and understand air polutiion patterns; assess which variables impact the most and present a model that can inform for the next 7 days air pollution levels and trend.

> * **Recommender Systems**: coming soon 
> * **Association Rules**: coming soon
> * **Natural Language Processing**: coming soon
> * **A/B Testing**: coming soon


* The projects include the following sections: (1) Project Summary: explains the dataset, describes the problem and presents business recommendations; (2) Exploratory Data Analysis; (3) ML pipeline; (4) ML Evaluation and Explanation: understands model performance and how features affect predictions; and (5) ML Experiment Mgt: compares performance among different models.

## Recommended (free) materials for Data Science
* [Google AI Education](https://ai.google/education/) - I found the courses very useful and easy to follow. I specially suggest Introd to ML Problem Framing course.
* [StatQuest YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw) - If you really want to understand (and apply) statistics and ML concepts, go there.
* [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/) - It shows not only technical aspects, but also touches project mgt, product design and insights on how to succeed on AI systems. At the end, guest lectures presentations showcase practical examples in the field.
* All Udemy courses from [Soledad G.](https://www.udemy.com/user/soledad-galli/) and [Christopher S.](https://www.udemy.com/user/christopher-samiullah/) - It's not free of charge, but Udemy offers discounts very often. It gave me the practical foundation for ML systems (create and deploy ML pipeline, unit test, logging, versioning, monitoring), it helps you to understand how to go from Research (Jupyter notebook) to Production. It worths to visit their [site](https://www.trainindata.com/) as well, great practical content. 
* [Machine Learning at Berkeley](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/tag/crash-course) - It offers a great technical foundation in ML.
* This bullet isn't a course recommendation, but more a professional suggestion: there might arrive a moment where you have to show your project's progress/conclusion, or even share an idea with the team. An interactive web app / web dashboard comes in hand. If you use Python, you could try [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/). If you prefer R, you could try [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). There are plenty of tutorials/references available on GitHub, YouTube, Stack Overflow etc. Ah, remember that ideally when you deploy your web-apps, they should be authenticated.
* Just complementing the previous bullet, if you use Python and is unsure which tool to use for creating/deploying dashboards, I suggest reading [this Medium article from Abdishakur](https://medium.com/spatial-data-science/the-best-tools-for-dashboarding-in-python-b22975cb4b83), it gives you a quick and simple overview from the most common options used nowadays.
