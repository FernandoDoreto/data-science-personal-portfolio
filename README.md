#  Welcome to my personal portfolio!

* Here you're going to find:
> * my latest **personal projects** and
> * recommended (free) materials for **learning and applying Data Science**.

## Professional Summary
* I have 9-year experience, combined, in Data Analytics, B2B Sales, and Software Development. Feel welcome to reach me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandodoreto/).
* Data Science for me is about **combining business experience and technology**. 
  * It doesn't matter if your technology is based on TensorFlow latest capabilities or on multiple Excel spreadsheets, if it's (1) integrated seamlessly with existing business processes and (2) reveals un-obvious/relevant insights, it worthed. 

## Projects Portfolio
* **NOTE**: when requested, both username and password are: **doreto**
* The projects include the following sections: (1) Project Summary, explaining the dataset, describing the problem to be solved and business recommendations; (2) Exploratory Data Analysis; (3) ML pipeline; (4) ML Evaluation and Explanation: understand model performance and how features effect target predictions; and (5) ML Experiment Mgt: compare performance among different models

## Recommended (free) materials for Data Science
* [Google ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) - I found the courses very useful and easy to follow. I specially suggest Problem Framing course.
* [StatQuest YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw) - If you really want to understand (and apply) statistics and ML concepts, go there.
* [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/) - It shows not only technical aspects, but also project mgt, product design and business insights on how to succeed on AI systems. Guest lectures presentations showcase practical examples in real world.
* ALL Udemy courses from [Soledad G.](https://www.udemy.com/user/soledad-galli/) and [Christopher S.](https://www.udemy.com/user/christopher-samiullah/) - It's not free, but Udemy offers discounts very often. It gave me the practical foundation for ML systems, it helps you to understand how to go from Research (Jupyter notebook) to Production. It worths to visit their [site](https://www.trainindata.com/) as well, great practical content. 
* [Machine Learning at Berkeley](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/tag/crash-course) - It offers a great technical foundation in ML.
* Web App: It will help you to jump from Jupyter Notebook to a more professional presentation. I cant remember at the moment free courses, but YouTube is there for you. If you use Python you could use [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) and start learning by yourself. If you prefer R, you could go to [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and start learning by your self. Remember that ideally when you deploy your web-apps, they should be authenticated.
